            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the Judicious Obſervation of one, that it is no marvaile if many things in nature, which are unknown in their cauſes be very wonderfull, when many naturall things, that are known, are no leſſe wonderfull, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſſe did not prevent our conſideration of them, and they would be no leſſe admired and queſtioned for preternaturall, if not ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known as they are. And amongſt ſome others this of Letters, whereby men ſpeak with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by their hands, and a man may diſcourſe with him that hath been dead ſome hundreds of
<pb facs="tcp:170348:13"/>years by taking up his booke and reading, as if he were raiſed from the dead to ſpake with him. It was the great goodneſs of God that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected ſome inſtruments at firſt to this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary help, upon many accounts to mankind in all the Affairs and concernments of life, and as an high improvement of this, no leſſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and gratious was that providence of God that ſet this way of printing on foot, which as it is ſuch in the thing it ſelfe; ſo in that (as it is obſerved) it was in ſuch a time when much uſe was made to a bad end of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men, wherein the vulgar were much abuſed and miſled by the falſe quotations and gloſſes upon the more rare and hard to be gotten written copies, that were then extant; as alſo, that when the light of the goſpell begun to break out again after a diſmall night of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition, there ſhould be ſuch a ready meanes prepared for the tranſmitting and diſperſing of this light all over the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches; the benefits of which bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence we and our fore-fathers have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taſted: And though I can not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the manifold miſchiefs and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a licentious unlicenſed preſſe, the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuſe and adulterating of this excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; yet the profit of printing, whereby we are made partakers of the labours of the Godly and and learned in former times and the labours of others may be transferred to poſterity, muſt needs be acknowledged as a glorious Mercy. <hi>I</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:170348:14"/>myſteries; a word to explaine, open, and endeavour to ſet on, what is plainly ſet forth in Scripture for mans ſalvation. And whatever I am of this (more I am not ſuſpected of, I am ſure) it is a ſpeciall guift of the Spirit to be a plain preacher, and upon this conſideration being conſcious to my ſelf of my own weakneſs, I ſhould have reſolvedly kept my ſelf retired, if I had known that none but the fruits of the guifts <hi>of Wiſdome,</hi> in the more accurate and judicious labours of men of higher parts and abilities, could be of uſe to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>I am (I bleſſe God) content with that part the Lord hath called me to act in his Church, and for which he hath in any meaſure furniſhed me, though much burthened and unſatisfied, that I do not what I might do to the utmoſt therein: and yet I oft think of what a judicious Divine once ſaid of one very famous for a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall preacher, that we were in a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we had no able. Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to deal with gain-ſayers, then ſuch as he. And I do bleſſe God that he hath furniſhed out many excellently qualified, and enabled to manage the controverſies of the times with much strength and and clearneſs, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth againſt all Oppoſers. And though the multitude of <hi>Polemick</hi> diſcourſes hath bred ſome inconvenience, and many of theſe worthy Champions well skill'd at their weapons have been too apt to fall from the publick ſervice, to
<pb facs="tcp:170348:14"/>engage in unhandſome and ſome unwarrantable duells, making many controverſies and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wholly perſonall, and ſo the fruit of this hath no way anſwered the time, parts and paines that have been uſed in it upon many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſions: yet to nauſeate or under value parts and labours this way, were for a peaceable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to throw away their defence and bulwarks in a trained military power for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we would have no Souldiers to defend us, our Enemies will find Souldiers to oppoſe us, and without reſiſtance by ſome well experienced Champions, to deſtroy us: And if we decry all polemick learning, we may ſoon be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by it in our adverſaries, who cheriſh it to the utmoſt; and cannot be oppugned, nor the truth defended againſt them, unleſs by ſome eminently skil'd in it on our ſide: Men could not have peace, if it were not for warre; few would ſoone be to live in reſt, if none to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine war upon occaſion: Beſides, theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men of God thus ſpecially qualified keep the Bulwarks, whilſt others leſſe fit for ſuch ſervice ſhould ſet on foot and improve the trade of religion, by which we muſt ſubſiſt and live eternally. Every miniſter ſhould have his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency in both, the word of Wiſdome, and the word of Knowledge, though ſome mens <hi>potior parts,</hi> may lie more in the one, and leſſe in the other. But controverſie maintains the truth, and practicall piety improves it, that, without ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on this, defends a ſhadow, fights for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:170348:15"/>while the heart and life is gone from it; this without that, lies open to uncertainty, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſturbances from oppoſers, and danger of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without a foundation, theſe can not well and truly be the one without the other, ſo likewiſe theſe do one, remotely yet often very effectually, the work of the other: Controverſies well ſtated and cleared in many points lay the foundation ſolid for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſſe to build on; and the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs heartily admitted doth notably prepare for the right judging of controverſies and tends much to the quieting of them. I have taken leave to commend in theſe lines that part which here I preſent not to you: But yet I am confident of it, that I may get leave for the, whoever thou art that art more in controverſies, then the ſtudy of thine own heart, to lay aſide thoſe things, til this be firſt done. It is very ſad when men when read controverſies to ſatisfie the luſt and curioſity of their own carnall mindes, rather then to enquire into the truth under them, for Gods glory and the affecting their hearts therewith which it is poſſible for thee to have done, read pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall books another while, and amongst the reſt this, if thou pleaſe: I would thou mighſt return to thoſe things another man, and leſſe of thoſe matters would ſerve the turn, Five may be put out by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fewel, as wel as by throwing on water; this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may heal diviſion by diverſions and by giving men a truer notion of differences, and of the ſeed and fuell of them from within us, which while the matter of prastical religion's neglected men have notwith them. The clenſing the ſtomack may prevent fumes into the head and cure the diſeaſe in that part this way. I
<pb facs="tcp:170348:15"/>I have purpoſeſly waved ſuch a notion of this very ſubject, as might have looked towards a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as alſo the like conſideration of it, referring to us as a nation gotten like the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time into a <hi>great tranſgreſſion,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſore judgments for the ſame, and what hopes might be in this thing I have but touched on the by; and all becauſe I ſee this other particular courſe to drive at the root of all diſeaſes amongſt us; if mens hopes were founded, ſecured, and improved about their own ſoules, it would ſoon give us a true ground of hope of things ſucceeding yet well in Church and ſtate. What God may be about to do with us of this Nation I am ſometimes deſirous to be enquiring after; the tokens of Gods diſpleaſure towards us are many as formerly, ſo of late more eſpecially in the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſtrang, epedemicall and of long continuance; ſuddain death; untimely and ſad accidents; the removall of the righteous, the Chariots of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the horſemen thereof, ſome hopefull young men prepared for the miniſtry prevented with the crown, before the Church had any tast of their labours (a mercy no doubt unto them, but ſharpeſt diſpleaſure unto us) Reformation ſadly at a ſtand; many, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleſs of any great evills upon us; many have been crying out of glorious times, till the very ſhadows of the evening are upon us, and we almoſt ſpent, the Nation ſecretly waſting and conſuming under our late brags of proſperity: the ſuddain and ſtrange revolutions; the turnings upſide down; the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward proceedings in the affairs of the ſtate. And what ſhall we think will become of us?
<pb facs="tcp:170348:16"/>well may we thus conclude, that if God intend to keepe us for his people he will reform us, and before we be reformed, the heart of the people of the land must be prepared to the Lord God of their fathers (for the want of that kept up the high places in good and reforming governours times,<note place="margin">2.

If theſe hopes here layd down were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as here indeavoured to be preſſed, we might of the generall threating ſtate of the whole ſay, that, <hi>There might yet now be hopes in Iſrael con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing.</hi>

            <p>That I ſhould adventure theſe papers into the world, it cannot be out of any conceipt I can have of any thing extraordinary in them, the profit of practical books I have had the comfortable experience of in my ſelf and others; the matter of this is not novell, neither every way common: The things

This receives interruption: at laſt at 2 bouts it gets up, <hi>as appears in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing chapters. Ezra</hi> is ſent, <hi>ch:</hi> 7. to reſtore Sacrifices. This was in the ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> 13 years before <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> came to build the walls of the City. But <hi>Ezra</hi> coming, and breaking up his commiſſion from the King, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet upon the work with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he came about, he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſaluted, with the ſad account of the peoples miſcarriage, in their marriage of ſtrange Wives, which ſtruck him into a great terrour and conſternation. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſitten ſilent about this matter, with his cloths rent, after the manner of a bitter mourner, who had his heart broken with this grievous miſcarriage of theirs, <hi>at the time of the evening Sacrifice,</hi> he makes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall lamentation, and confeſſion of the Sin to God, in the Prayer or rather complaint, which you find: <hi>ch.</hi> 9 wherein you do not find any petition he could frame to put up for them, the matter he judged ſo hainous, but all he could ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, was to aggravate it, and to leave the matter with the Lord, ſaying, <hi>he was not able to ſtand before the Lord becauſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170348:19"/>this.</hi> The people, upon this Lamentation of his, flock together, and <hi>Schecaniah</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Ezra</hi> about the buſineſſe: and he joyns with him in acknowledging the miſcarriage of the people, but he would not have it thus left as a matter deſperate, but declares his opinion of the caſe, that it is yet hopeful, and he propoſed the way he conceived for cure, which was, by making a covenant for reformation, in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, wherein they had ſo groſly offended.</p>
               <p>Who this <hi>Schecaniah</hi> was, that made this ſpeech: we find no mention of him before, nor after, ſave only in this place he is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of Jehiel;</hi> one of that name is mentioned to be one of the Prieſts, that had ſinned in this matter, enumerated among the offenders. <hi>v.</hi> 21 whether he was his Son or no, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable. If he was he might the better take himſelf concernd in the buſineſs, and take the ſin the more to himſelf, for his Fathers ſake; however it is probable he was a man of good place and authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, in that he offers to aſſiſt <hi>Ezra</hi> in driving on the covenant for reformation of the ſin, and, as a good man, grieves under Gods diſhonour, as <hi>Ezra</hi> did, confeſſes the thing was hainous and ſad, yet he tells <hi>Ezra,</hi> he thinks it muſt not be ſo left. But ſees that <hi>yet there is Hope (yet now)</hi> for all this (which is too
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170348:20"/>true of us) that we have ſinned thus hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly (now) Now I ſee the people thus meet together, I have a better heart of the thing.</p>
               <p>(There is Hope) the matter is not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, there is ſome Hope in it.</p>
               <p>(In <hi>Iſrael</hi>) or concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as anon we may ſhew <hi>Iſraels</hi> covenant of being the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gives them hope upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance yet of Mercy. It is a greater ſin for being <hi>Iſraels,</hi> yet in <hi>Iſrael</hi> there is more Hope about it, then if it had been in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, if they repent of it.</p>
               <p>(Concerning this thing) this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſin that is committed, and the judgment that is feared; this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſtrange Wives, the matter of the preſent conſternation. There is yet Hope about it.</p>
               <p>The better to bottome the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I intend to raiſe from the words; I ſhall preface the larger upon the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in making inquiry into 3 things, which yet are all obvious to us in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the text.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) What was the ſcope of <hi>Schecaniah</hi> his words here? what is the drift of them?</p>
               <p n="1">(1) To comfort <hi>Ezra</hi> in the buſineſſe; he ſaw him dejected about it: he bids him be of good cheere though it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170348:20"/>it was bad, yet it might do well, there was a way yet out; there was Hope in the thing.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) To encourage him to ſet about the duty; Hope puts life into repentance and reformation. Becauſe I ſee Hope in the thing, let us fall upon the uſe of meanes for the peoples recovery.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) In reſpect of all in generall he aſſerts his apprehenſions of the preſent ſtate, and that <hi>Ezra</hi> had left it too ſhort; to conclude, as if there could be nothing to be further done. <hi>Hereby</hi> implying it was not their duty to deſpaire in the thing, but rather to ſet upon the meanes yet left for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>But Secondly wherein was the matter ſo difficult? <hi>Ezra</hi> leaves it as almoſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs, and <hi>Schecania</hi> ſaies, there is but Hopes in the thing. Hope implies a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. The matter was very dangerous. For</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It was a matter of ſin, that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; if it had been a judgement only, it had not been ſo amazing, but it was a ſin that they diſcovered; a ſin without a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as yet inflicted, is more amazing, to Godly men, then judgement without a viſible ſin. It was not a matter of famine, or oppreſſion and ſickneſſe, but it was a matter of Sin, and therefore trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a very dangerous ſin, in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170348:21"/>very nature and proper influence and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, where it takes place.<note place="margin">Deut 7 34</note> 
                  <hi>They had married ſtrange Wives,</hi> a thing expreſly forbidden; the reaſon given, Becauſe theſe women would go nigh to draw them to ſtrange Gods,<note place="margin">Neb. 13.26.</note> exemplified ſadly to their conſtant experience, and in <hi>Salomons</hi> caſe, <hi>even him,</hi> that wiſe King, <hi>did outlandiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cauſe to ſin. Ezra</hi> ſaw al Religion hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereby; he might think all his laborfru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by this ſin of theirs, and that it was to ſmal purpoſe for him to ſet up ſacrifices; for theſe ſtrange Wives would ſoon draw their hearts from them and God too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaw ſo many enſnared in this ſin. Many of the great men, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and all, as you ſee <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 18. &amp;c. and therefore more heinous before God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting near to an univerſall guilt upon them, more exemplary and ſcandalous, and harder to be reformed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He conſidered this ſin they were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into to be ſadly aggravated, in that ſo ſoone after their return from captivity a grievous judgement, wherein they had ſo heavily ſuffered for ſuch like doings. To be ſinning again upon a new ſcore, when building upon the ruins, which their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins had immediately made, Alas? might he think,<note place="margin">Joſh. 21.17.</note> when will this people mend? when will they be warned to leave ſin? <hi>Is the iniquity of Poor too little for us?</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170348:21"/>Is the Iniquity of our former Idolatry too little for us? <hi>from which the land is not yet purged to this day.</hi> But muſt we ſo ſoon begin again? It is very ſad; this you ſee laid the thing ſadder on his heart. <hi>ch:</hi> 9. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He conſidered the ſin the greater, in that it was committed by them, that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the judgment ſo narrowly. It was not long ſince, when it might have been queſtioned, whether ever this people: ſhould have been a people any more, and now to find them ſuch a rebellious people! They might have periſhed in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as many thouſands did, and therefore it is very ſad to find them thus groſly ſinning here. Chap. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>having had ſuch a deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy commandements?</hi> If they would have ſtrange Wives,<note place="margin">Ier. 7.10.</note> If they would have ſtrange Wives, they ſhould have tarried ſtill in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Are <hi>they delivered to do all theſe abominations?</hi> muſt the Lord have them for ſuch work as this is? Oh! it is very intollerable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their danger is great, there is no judgement yet on them, the ſoarer one may be expected; God knows what's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.<note place="margin">Deut. 7.4</note> 
                  <hi>The anger of the Lord is kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people</hi> upon ſuch a ſin as this is, and ſure all good wil be at a ſtand about it, and ſome ſpeedy ruine ſhall overtake us. Alas! alas! who can tell, what may, nay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170348:22"/>what may not befall ſuch a rebellious da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people? <hi>Ezra</hi> from this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was thus amazed, concludes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he could not for ſhame tell how to move one word for this people in this caſe, they had ſo baſely miſcarried, and therefore he leaves the Buſineſs in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before God, not moving one word on the peoples behalf, as it were not knowing what to ſay for them, nor what to think miſerable enough, that might be towards them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What were the grounds <hi>Schecaniah</hi> had of hopes in this difficult caſe. <hi>There is yet hope in</hi> Iſrael <hi>concerning this thing.</hi> Whence had he this hope, that things might yet frame well?</p>

There is very much in it in turning betime, ſome they ſeek God, when they have no ſoar, no ſickneſs, no judgment on them, and yet they tremble before the Lord, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it is a very good ſigne.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170348:24"/>this while going on, God hath it on foot, and is ſecretly bringing it on, for all this. And ſo in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe. He as ſoone as he was made King, though <hi>Saul</hi> in all his raigne would never thinke of bringing up the Arke, he makes it his firſt deſigne.<note place="margin">2.

And ſo the work of reformation, though by the meanes of enemies, and falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren it ſeeme to receive obſtruction, that God ſeemes to refuſe the ſervice, that his poor Miniſters would do him therein, hath made breaches upon us, on ſome eminent reformers in the very worke, yet there is Hope in this thing: Reformation hath a bleſſing with it where it is,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 20.33.</note> and when God hath <hi>prepared the heart of his</hi> people to ſeek him in the right way, the Arke of God may yet reſt in his own place in the midſt of us.

                  <p>The Nature of the Sinners Hope, as his Priviledge and Duty, truly ſtated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. HOw far, or in what ſenſe is this to be underſtood, that ſinners in ſuch caſes as theſe, ſhould yet take notice of, and cheriſh their hopes? In this we ſhall, by the way, endeavour to ſet out, how far we ſhould give way to trouble in caſe of ſin, in our daily courſe, and how far we muſt avoid it. How near we may come to conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch caſes, and how far, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we muſt fly from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How it is not to be underſtood? We muſt in theſe caſes hope, yet,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not ſo, as <hi>not to ſee, and confeſs our ſin,</hi> we are not ſo to clap on the Plaiſter, as to hide, inſtead of healing the Sore, the Sore muſt be opened and ſearched, before the Plaiſter be laid on. This elſe were a way to cover, rather then cure the ſin: <hi>He that covereth his ſin cannot proſper;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.23.</note> 
                  <hi>but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh ſhall find mercy. David</hi> while he <hi>kept ſilence,</hi> would have hidden his ſin, he was in ſad diſtreſs of

               <p n="2">2. Not ſo, <hi>as not to be under a ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure,</hi> for what we have done; this hope is not to be ſo fomented, as to make a man think, that God is not diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with what we have done; though there may be hope, he may be again pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: we are to look at God under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, as placable, yet as provoked at it. It is not to hope that God is not angry, but that his anger may be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again. <hi>David</hi> had contrived and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on his wickedneſs; but thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>The thing that</hi> David <hi>had done diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Lord:</hi>

                  </note> the Lord was really of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it. <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> the Lord would pardon him, yet <hi>there was wrath out againſt him for what he had done.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 19.2.</note> We are to hope, yet not ſo, as to force kindneſs from God upon our ſelves, to fancy that God looks over our miſcarriages, without any diſtaſt of them, to fancy, that ſuch things as theſe ſhall never be lookt after, as the profane Athieſt that ſaies,<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Tuſh, the Almighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not,</hi> he will not require it. Who ever do thus, it is not ſuch a hope that God hath left them; not ſuch an <hi>Antinomian</hi> fancy, to think, that God loves us ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170348:28"/>fondly, as to love us in the very act of ſin, in our very wickedneſs. This is not Faith, we ought not to hope thus, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all reaſon and Scripture grounds: there may be hope, yet diſpleaſure too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not ſo to hope, <hi>As not to be aſhamed truly before God,</hi> for what we have done: it is Impudence in us to look upon God as confidently, as if we had done nothing amiſs; this ſetting a Face upon our ſins, as if we had not offended at all. <hi>Ezra</hi> was <hi>aſhamed and confounded, and could not ſtand before the Lord;</hi>

                  <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi> This was a great Complaint, and God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them for it; <hi>Therefore they ſhall fall among them</hi> that fall.<note place="margin">Jer. 2.26.</note> 
                  <hi>As a Thief is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo is the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>aſhamed:</hi> As a man reputed to be honeſt, &amp; is catcht ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is ill abaſht; or one that hath uſed ſtealing, and is catcht ſo doing, is made to carry his ſtoln Goods back again in his hand, is fearfully aſhamed of it.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170348:28"/>becauſe of it, and yet hope too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not ſo to hope, <hi>As not to be very much humbled and vile in his own Eyes.</hi> He is not ſo to run to his hopes, as to ſave his due humiliation for what he hath done, to think baſely and vilely of himſelf for his miſcarriage: we are apt <hi>either to deſpair in our ſelves and God too, or elſe to hope in God and our ſelves too;</hi> whereas we muſt divide in this caſe, and hope in God, yet utterly deſpair in our ſelves. Oh! upon ſuch a ſtraight, we ought to ſee the vileneſs and weakneſs of our ſelves herefrom. Oh! this is my baſe and perverſe Spirit? this is my folly and wretchedneſs, this is that which is the beſt my heart will bring forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet hope in God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not ſo to hope,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.1.</note> 
                  <hi>As not to ſee our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute need to Chriſt:</hi> to hope ſo in ſuch caſes is ſinfull hope. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus who is our hope.</hi> Though ſin ſhould not drive us to deſpair, yet it ſhould drive us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone to hope in: We are ſo far to be troubled, as to make ſute to our <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> to ſpeak a good word for us: Hope, to skip <hi>beſides, or without Chriſt</hi> to Souls eaſe, is ſad, prepoſterous, and unchriſtian hope.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Not ſo to hope, <hi>As not to combat and ſtrive to the utmoſt againſt the ſin:</hi> We are not to hope that the ſin ſhall be pardoned, if we ſtill allow it. It is not an hope to

               <p>But ſecondly, How is it to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? We are not in caſes of ſin to give way to conſternation of mind ſo far; As (1.) in generall.</p>

What ever we are, we muſt leave God as we find him in Scripture; while we bring down our ſelves, we muſt not go about to bring down him too: while we truly diſcover our own badneſs, we muſt be carefull we diſparage not his Goodneſs; what ever caſe we are in,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.5 &amp; 103.8.

It is not for thee to make Decrees; thou knoweſt not, what ever thou art at preſent, what yet God may make thee,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.26.</note> and what thou mayſt come to before thou dieſt: <hi>With God all things are poſſible,</hi> Sinners ought therefore to be ſparing in their finall determinations concerning themſelves, for ſecret things belong to God, <hi>And many ſuch things are with him.</hi> It is a mercy thou art not in Hell already, and it may be hoped, thou ſhalt not in the end ever come there.</p>

               <p>The third ground,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1. Rev. 22.17. Jo. 7 37.</note> 
                  <hi>The univerſall tender</hi> of mercy, <hi>who ever will,</hi> let him come. <hi>The great day of the Feaſt,</hi> when moſt people
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170348:33"/>was there, he makes the Proclamation, That who ever is a thirſt, may come to him and drink. Hence (as one ſaies) He was born in an Inn, not in a private Houſe, and crucified out of the City, and not within <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe the buſineſs and benefit of his Birth and Death was not of private concernment, not to be confined to one place, or one people: the Goſpel is to be preached to <hi>every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

               <p>The fourth ground, <hi>The freeneſs of this tender,</hi> Come and buy, and he that <hi>hath no mony</hi> come: I can but have nothing; the worſt Chapman that can come to the Market, can be but he that <hi>hath neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nor price;</hi> and yet ſuch as theſe may ſpeed well, and go home beſt provided.

               <p>The fifth ground, <hi>That nothing is required at our hands, but the ſame is promiſed unto us.</hi> I may come to Chriſt for the Condition, and upon that Condition for Pardon: the nature of the Covenant is wonderfull; he hath promiſed to perform both parts,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.32. &amp; 24.7. &amp; 32.39.40.</note> there is nothing I can find at any time, that may incapacitate me, or hinder me
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170348:33"/>for comfort; but before I caſt off my hopes, I may ſee that very thing promiſed that is required: and ſure this well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, doth wonderfully fit a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians turn upon many pinches, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould be at a loſs in about his comfort. We cannot apply Chriſt but upon condition, but bleſſed be God, we are not to find the Condition in our ſelves, or at our own proper coſt (which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done) but we are readily directed, where to have it. If I cannot challenge Chriſt to be mine for want of an Intereſt, I may go to him for an Intereſt. If I cannot apply him for want of Faith or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or any other Grace, I may go to him for Faith and Repentance, and that Grace; ſo that ſtill I have ſomething elſe fair before me to do, then preſently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, when any ſuch ſtraight is upon me.</p>

There is a Mean of hope between theſe, which is thy duty; to deſpair for ſin is ſin, and to give way to trouble to the utter dejection of a mans heart before God, is to give way to a ſin: you think you do but bring down
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170348:34"/>ſelf hereby, but beware You take not God down with you; this deſpair brings God no honour, hinders thy doing, makes thee uſeleſs, nay, directly reflects upon God, in that thou haſt ſuch hard thoughts of him, and acteſt againſt his expreſs will and pleaſure.

                  <hi>He that ploweth ploweth in hope;</hi> or elſe the ſharpneſs of the ſeaſon and the hardneſs of the labour would make him ſit ſtill. <hi>Hanun,</hi> that had ſo villainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated <hi>David</hi>'s Meſſengers,<note place="margin">2 Sa. 10.6.</note> ſaw he had done ſo vilely, that his Action ſtank in the Noſtrills of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that he had no way but to prepare for War: So ſinners, when they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſtate as deſperate, they are likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to go on, as if they were tied to make it out, and to ſtand, or fall by it. <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> would at any time make his Enemy a Bridge of Gold to fly away upon, rather then force them to fight. When a ſinner ſees no hope of quarter, he hath much ado to yield to be ſlain, but rather being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, if he be without hopes of life, he will ſell his life as dear as he can. A Soldier in the Army, that had a mortall Diſeaſe upon him, was obſerved to look like death, and yet to fight moſt valiantly, the Emperour took him for his Valour, and had his diſtemper ſearched into, and he became cured: After this, he was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be ſo daring and venturous, as before; The Emperour asked him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſaid, Before he lookt upon himſelf as a dying man, and therefore mattered not to have been killed, but now his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170348:35"/>was cured, he would take more care, for he had a life to ſave now, as well as another. So when ſinners think they have done that already, that cannot be forgiven, that muſt neceſſarily ruine them without redemption; it rather makes them more deſperate in the charges and on-ſet in their courſes, but if once they ſee hopes of life dawn, they will not be ſo prodigall of their Souls, becauſe they think they may eſcape, as well as another. God hath for the ſame reaſon made you way enough to come off upon, golden Bridges to retreat on, which may put life into your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a ſparing courſe in ſin, and to come off by repentance. <hi>Thy repentance would ſtrengthen thy Hopes, thy Hopes draw on thy Repentance.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Thou haſt ſinned, and thou knoweſt thou haſt cauſe <hi>to think ill of thy ſelf,</hi> and thou art <hi>loath to think ſo well of God,</hi> as that he is notwithſtanding ready to pardon.

Thou wouldſt either trample upon patience, or deny it;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance.</hi> Oh! to ſee God ſo ready to forgive, and thou ſo ready to ſin: thou ſo eaſily to forget him, and he ſo hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thee; thou ſo treacherous, and he ſo gracious: Oh! how unlike are God and we? how might it break thy heart to conſider it? But we are apt to ſtudy to diſparage, at leaſt, we would not honour, the party we injure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou art <hi>hath to be ſo beholden to him,</hi> as to think of hopes of pardon; hope implies preſent need and poverty: thou art loath to ſubmit, and ſtandeſt rather on thy juſtification, wouldſt fain come off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another ſcore, then that of a pardon on thy knees: men are very loath to ſubmit to free Grace, no ſmall matter to have that inward ſenſe of wretchedneſs, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to run out after ſalvation <hi>for Gods ſake.</hi> There is a carnall enmity in the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts ſoveraignty, thou wouldſt not be <hi>Conquered,</hi> but ſtand for thy Native Priviledge; truly loath to ſtoop ſo low
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170348:36"/>as to take a pardon at his hands. And is not this ſin of an high nature? Is this a temper to be indulged? there is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pride in deſpair that looks ſo low.</p>

Who is apt to think there is any hope in altering, in a buſineſs he hath a mind to be as it is? Obedience is the thing we ſtick at, we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a love to ſin, and ſo would cover it, with this pretence, that there is no hope, if we ſhould repent. Men that would clear their ſincerity in their troubles, might do well to lay aſide their ſin in the firſt place, and after to get hopes as they can: but many times perſons cry out of their hopeleſs condition, when ſecretly they hug their ſin ſtill.

                  <hi>How hard is it for a rich man to enter into Heaven?</hi> Eaſie for a rich man to profeſs Religion, but hard for him ſavingly to be religious; eaſie for him to do nothing ſo well, as to poſt to Hell and deſtruction.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170348:40"/>Hell that a man can go. As Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> ſaid of Martyrdome for Heaven, ſo I may ſay of Worldlineſs under Profeſſion, if there be a way <hi>to Hell on Horſe-back,</hi> this is it: If thou have taken up Profeſſion, and yet in heart loveſt the World, thy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very dangerous; when the Word and Miniſtry would come to heal thee, thou ſalveſt thy ſelf by thy Profeſſion, and wilt not be the carnall man, when ſuch a one is ſpoken to, and yet loveſt the World carnally and damnably, and wilt ruine thy ſelf this way. And thus covertly keepeſt thy heart wicked, to go to Hell with them when thou dieſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Of an Apoſtate Heretick.</hi> Oh, ſuch as theſe are hardly ſaved, if ſaved at all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15.</note>

                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.11, 12.</note> to the efficacy of Deluſions, that they may believe Lyes, and all this in the end to be damned. Theſe poor Wretches if ſaved at all, we ſave them with fear, as plucking them out of the fire, Hell-fire being ready to kindle on them, by the light of which they ſeem to walk, while they are here. O! fly the Tents of theſe wicked men, whoſe ſtate is ſo dangerous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Of a Death-bed Penitent.</hi> Oh! this ſtate is very hazardous, men then to have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170348:41"/>all their work to do, and undo, when they are unfit to do any thing, and can have ſo little certainty of their own reality in any thing they profeſs, then to deſire to do. A man may in fear of Death ſeem to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſin,<note place="margin">Inſtructions to afflicted Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and think verily himſelf he doth do it, and yet if he recover, be as ready to take it up as ever, which eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the little hold a man can have of his own heart at ſuch a time. Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> tels of a Thief that was condemned, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo penitent while under the Sentence of Death, that ſome, out of hopes of his reall Converſion, beg'd his life: and this man was within two years after Executed for ſtealing again. Theſe Experiences make us very little ſatisfied in any profeſſions of Repentance at Death, after a groſly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life; God may honour himſelf by your acknowledgment of him, and chooſing to die in his way, and our Charity is bound up, and we leave you, not determining of your caſe, but our Charity will not certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for you, to make good your entrance into life, you may be judged for all this according to your life, and be eternally undone: It is good repenting therefore, when a man knows what he doth, what he himſelf means, which on a ſick Bed one cannot do. It is poor going for any man into another World, with that prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, that a ſick Bed can furniſh him with.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170348:41"/>
               <p n="2">2. Yet there be ſome Conditions, not only leſs hopefull then others, but quite <hi>in a manner hopeleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>a Profeſſor that turns Perſecuter.</hi> Oh, this is very high, when men leave God and revolt to the other ſide; it is no mean wickedneſs will ſerve their turn, as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> ſaid of <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sa. 29.4.</note> 
                  <hi>How ſhall he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile himſelf to his Maſter, but by the heads of theſe men?</hi> So how ſhall this man be taken to heart in <hi>Satans</hi> Army, unleſs he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Credit by more open Hoſtility, then ever he did act in before. No <hi>Turk</hi> ſo bad as the <hi>Renegado</hi> Chriſtian, and ſurely this is ſuch an high Indignity to Chriſt, and the Spirit of Grace: this is ſuch a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight,</hi> ſuch <hi>a trampling under foot the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of the Covenant,</hi> that ſuch a one ſeldome or never recovers. A Back-ſlider may return, but then he ſtops there: but a Back-ſliding Perſecutor he goes ſo far the other way, that there is ſcarce any room for him to turn on. Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> tells of one in his time that deſpaired, that had once been a Profeſſor; and after mocked at the Truth, judging that he had ſin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy-ghoſt, and how he bad him go home to his Prayers, and he would to his Study; and another day tell him what he thought: For (ſaies he) I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it well enough, but could not well declare it, but I will bungle at it as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170348:42"/>well as I can: and ſo he anſwered, and after aſſerted in the caſe: that <hi>Privilegium paucorum non deſtruit regulam univerſalem;</hi> This man (ſaies he) I knew that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and many to have done as he did; and yet never a one returned but he. We would endeavour to find a Door open for ſuch to get out at, if they got repentance; but uſually ſuch engage ſo far, that they come hardly to repent. A Perſecuter at firſt hand may be converted, but one of theſe God ſeldome gives repentance to, that he may turn again: and this is but too common a thing, which I mention, to make men tremble that are ſecure and careleſs, as too many are; that at firſt, when (it may be) they were low in the World, they profeſſed Religion, but when gotten a little great and rich, they begin to ſlight their Profeſſion, and ſtick not to mock and ſcoff at the beſt people, though (it may be) under the notion of ſuch a Party, diſſenting from the worſer ſort in ſome Diſciplinary Controverſle, but this will not excuſe their hatred and affront to Religion it ſelf, and men may ſoon engage further, then they can eaſily come off in ſuch a deſperate courſe: and therefore let them that have profeſſed, beware what they do, they bring an evill report upon Religion, they advance the Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they harden many to their ruine,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170348:42"/>and fearfully bar out their own repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: If you do go off, beware to take heed how far you go: of all kind of Sinners beware of being a Perſecuter, and of all Perſecuters, let the Apoſtate Perſecuter look about him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A man that forſakes the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> prophanely, or otherwiſe, there is little or no hopes of: the Ordinances are the Means, which God doth ordinarily uſe to make men better by; and therefore this is a ſin of an high nature, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Means of being changed. This made Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſay, Come to Church if it be but to ſleep there, for God may take thee napping; the Miniſter may awake thee, if there, and God may together with it awaken thy Soul: if you lye in Chriſts way, there is hopes; if you be about the Pool, though you cannot get in, yet you may be healed: but when men go quite out of all high waies, their Conditions are heavily markt out for dangerous. Alas! it is ſome more then ordinary ſervice and ſecurity the Devill deſigns from you, if he prevail upon you this way, to get you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Ordinances, and to get a trick of idling at home on the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> If men be wicked, yet if they go to the publick Ordinances, the Devill is not ſo ſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: a word ſet on by Preaching, may drive him out of poſſeſſion of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170348:43"/>worſt of you; and therefore when he deſigns to have ſome more then ordinary ſecurity of you, that you ſhall be true to his ſervice, and be his for ever, never to over-run his Colours, he would break you off from Ordinances, and then he needs look no more after you, unleſs it be to ſet you on ſome eminent Piece of Work for him, which only ſuch a one is fit for. He may have hopes of many that go to Church; that he ſhall light of a good ſhare of them, but this puts him to pains, and he is oft made to be-ſtir himſelf, ſince the Ordinances of God make Batteries on his Holds, and he is lyable to be turned at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon, out of ſome heart, and Sinners by long Sieges may be forced to yield: but when he knows he hath a ſtrong Garriſon within, and hath removed them from all Leagures, he may leave that Soul, and find it at any time ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to him.</p>
               <p>We in Chriſts behalf, what Promiſes ſoever any make to us, can have no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of you, if you keep ſtill in looſe and bad Company: No more can he have hold of any for Hell, as long as ſtill they are frequenting Publick Ordinances.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that do thus, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign to be ſure of them, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſome more then ordinary Service from them; theſe men are like to ſerve
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170348:43"/>him in any thing he puts upon them, they keep out of the way of having any thing to hinder them. What is there to hinder the vileſt thought of taking place? of Corruption riſing to an height in the heart? go to the Church and ſome word may meet it, and give check to it, that if men be wicked, yet they cannot afford to be ſo very wicked: but when he hath you out of the noiſe, of the word, <hi>no Voyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you,</hi> to tell you of another way, you know not what wickedneſs you ſhall ſtop at. Thus have I heard of, and known ſome, that have ended their daies on the Gallows, that have confeſſed, that the firſt ſtep towards that Ignominious Death, hath been their <hi>Sabbath</hi>-breaking. When men dare turn their backs on Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſit at home, it is hard to think what Meditations they may have at home; nay, what for vileneſs and wretchedneſs may they not have? Sure <hi>Satan</hi> hath a deſign to take you from Gods teaching, that he may have you in ſecret, and on Gods own Day, to teach you wholly at home. <hi>If idling at home be thy Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies work, no marvail, if Thieving, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and what not be thy Sabbath-daies Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations?</hi> Alas! it is not a matter of Cloaths.</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Ja. 2.1.2, 3 4, 5.</note> God hath enjoyned us not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in our ſelves, and to judge <hi>after evill
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170348:44"/>Thoughts;</hi> a poor man in vile Rayment, in caſe of Conteſt, is not to be under-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, but to be equally adminiſtred to in a way of Juſtice, as the rich man in coſtly Apparell, <hi>with his Gold Ring on his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and if you come into theſe Aſſemblies, much more, we ſhall be as glad to ſee you as greater men, and as much deſire the Salvation of your Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sure it is a greater ſhame to ſtay at home needleſly, then to appear at Church in the pooreſt Rayment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Divell will venture to teach you in Rags.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And beſides, ſee what a Deſign the Divell hath carried on againſt you: it may be, you have been of better faſhion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your Neighbours, and you have drunk your ſelves out of your Cloaths, your former going to Church hath not hindred your looſe living, and now he hath brought you to beggery, and ſo aſhamed to go to Church at all, and now he may do what he will with you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But when you come to die, and find the want of what you ſhould die with, and this upon your Conſciences, that you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the means of getting it, what a rage will this leave you in?</p>
               <p n="6">6. And beſides all this, the Damned in Hell, if they might have leave to come to the Ordinances, would make it no matter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170348:44"/>of Cloaths; they would be glad to hear a Sermon for the good of their Soules, though in the pooreſt Cloaths that ever man wore.</p>
               <p>But men that do thus, there is the leaſt hopes poſſibly of them of any again. And thoſe that leave the publick Ordinances out of Conſcience, their Condition is no better, they are to lead the Divels Van, they are gone through Profeſſion to the Divels Camp on the other ſide. <hi>They frame miſchief by a Law:</hi> They forſake Aſſemblies, and juſtifie it, and doubly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Ordinance of Chriſt; and theſe are more unlike to return to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies again, and as ſure as any, to feel the damning effects of their neglect of them. This for thoſe that are very hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, We may ſhew, <hi>what our hopes are of any of you,</hi> that are yet vile and live in ſin: Why, truly we may, to affect your hearts with it, open our very hearts to you about your Eſtate; As indeed it were but reaſonable, that you ſhould ask your Miniſters advice about your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you are not apt to truſt your Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for your Eſtates, without the advice of your Lawyer: For your bodily Health, you are willing to ask the Phyſitian, and and very earneſtly ſometimes deſire him to tell you, what he thinks of you, both becauſe you judge the matter is Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170348:45"/>and that their skill in the buſineſs is rather to be truſted then yours, ſince better verſt in it: and how comes it, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is ſo ſeldome Conſulted with in the caſe of the immortall Soul? is it becauſe the matter is of leſs Concernment, or you have skill enough to judge your ſelves? Or that Miniſters are to no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of purpoſe? As for the uſe that a great many make of them, they were the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeſt Officers that ever were ſet on foot) or intruth, is it becauſe you leaſt matter this buſineſs of any? But we may in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tell you, what our thoughts are of you <hi>Gratis:</hi> Sure we may ſay of the very vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt that hear us, there is hopes; and we tell you in our God, <hi>we have hopes of you,</hi> of the vileſt Drunkard, unclean, prophane perſon in the Congregation; thus far it may be it <hi>pleaſeth you,</hi> and we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour your <hi>profit,</hi> as much in what we ſhall ſay further.

But then this would be an objection, I know not the myſterie of the trade, I was not an apprentice to it; and know not how to ſet about it, but if one ſhould tel him that there is ſuch a one would teach him all, inſtruct him in everie particular, ſure if the ſtick was not in the friend that ſhould doe the courteſie, it ſhould never ſtick at the partie that needs, but he would gladly imbrace the motion and without delay ſet upon the matter which ſo much concerns him. This is the caſe of many ignorant ſoules, it is eaſie for You to ſee, that in the way You are in You can never ſubſiſt, If you ſaw your own condition you might eaſilie be aware of it, that this life will never hold, this way will not ſerve the turn, The way of Sin will undo you, You can never be quiet while You drive this trade, every Sermon will fright you, (as wo to us,) if we ſpeak

You might fear like a broken tradſeman every creature might arreſt You for Hell, You are in a ſad condition for death, that in theſe ſicklie times, may come within theſe 3. Or 4, daies.

Alas, this is the malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the croſsneſs of Nature. The Devill would hurrie thee into another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, but the Mean between theſe two is the right.

It may be at preſent he dares not ſhew his face to the King, to claim the benefit of his pardon and the Kings favour, but he lays down his armes and will fight no more. Why this is a good beginning: ſo one may take ſome Soules between their ſins, and

Thou maieſt be ready to ſay, But ſure if God did intend to ſhew mercy on me he would have done it before now, he would not have kept me off all this while if ever I muſt have come on, ſure ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for good he would have ſhewed ere now; If he had liked my coming.

But I ſhall to drive thy trouble paſt this ſtop, ſhew thee that God may in love to they ſoul at preſent withhold ſenſible comforts from thee.

               <p>I. God may withdraw, <hi>to make thee lay a ſolid foundation,</hi> not only for near ſins but in <hi>humiliation for all former ſins.</hi> The terrous abides to ſearch the ſore to the bottome. God may intend to drive up thy humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170348:84"/>for the very ſins of thy youth. <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> bemoaned himſelfe till he bore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his youth. <note place="margin">Jer. 31.19</note>And then God ſmiles on him, ſaies he is <hi>a pleaſant child.</hi> Alas, if theſe ſins ſhould not be ſearcht out, and ſhould lie within unrepented of, thy matter would be fowly hudled up, and when theſe things were at after ſearched for, it would marr all thy comforts again. God would make through work with thee. Thou wouldſt it may be quit ſcores with God, draw gloves with him. That all that hath paſt ſhould ſtand for nothing, and if thou mighteſt have pardon for all that is paſt, thou wouldſt mend for the time to come: But this will not ſerve, thou muſt be willing to bring out the old ſcore, thou muſt undoe as much as in thee lies what before thou haſt done, acknowledgment muſt be made, ſatisfaction to God and man as much as in you lies; or God will not be friends with you. You muſt be willing to take ſhame for your former doings, If you would find favour for the time to come, reſolve therefore to do thy duty in this thing. Humble thy ſelfe for all former ſins, hide nothing from God, make cleare work, as farr as you goe, for what is paſt, and you are ſo farr on your way towards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>2. It may be, <hi>to ſearch thy heart for ſome regarded ſin,</hi> that God ſtill frowns on thee.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170348:85"/>And indeed it would be ſad for thee, if God ſhould ſmile on thee, and any ſin lodged in thy ſoul. The ſin that troubles thee moſt, is not alwaies the cauſe of thy trouble, that ſin that is in open view, is not ſo dangerous, but it is the ſin that lies in a corner, that ſays nothing, the thing thou leaſt ſuſpecteſt, that keeps thy wound from healing, ſome thing that is hidden from the Phyſitian, that makes the phyſick will not work, ſomething that is a ſinn, that thou wilt not have to be a ſin, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would be ſearched and tryed, and if there was any <hi>way of wickedneſſe in him.</hi> So there may be ſome hidden way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thee,<note place="margin">Pſ. 136. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> and till thou be willing to let Chriſt come into every roome, to throw out what he will, to be abſolute Lord in thy Soul, It is not for thy good that thou ſhouldſt have comfort, Chriſt may have that of thee now that he knows he cannot have afterwards, and therefore ſtands off, till thou be of a mind univerſally to cloſe with him. It may be thou mayſt live in paſſion, in the faſhions of the world in the ſin of uſury, Wilt have ſomething lawfull which is not. If God love thee he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let this <hi>way of wickedneſſe</hi> remaine in thee. The great matter of controverſy that would make way for thy peace, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt or thou ſhall make the Law? If Chriſt be admitted as the compleate legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170348:85"/>he will ſhortly come to thee, but till then he will ſtand off, as it is beſt for thee. And therefore in thy trouble do this duty, deſire God to ſearch thee, look to all thy ways, pray the Lord to ſhew thee thy ſin, that offends him,<note place="margin">Job. 34 32.</note> in the words of <hi>Elihu that which I ſee not, teach thou me, If I have done in iquity I will do no more,</hi> and this will <hi>bring</hi> the <hi>work up</hi> with thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God may withold his face from thee <hi>to bring thee more cleerly and univerſally over unto him,</hi> and this is much for thy good: Chriſt would have men count what it will coſt them to be Chriſtians when they come to him. The great queſtion now upon thy turning is, as before ſaid, who muſt give thee law! whether thou or Chriſt, whether thou wilt do in all things as thou wilt or as thou haſt <hi>been wont,</hi> or as the <hi>moſt uſe,</hi> or whether as <hi>Chriſt pleaſeth</hi> in every thing? <hi>Ephraim was chaſtiſed</hi> for he was <hi>a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer 41.18.19.20</note> Would not keep the furrows, nor draw quietly in his geeres. God chaſtizes him till he is tamed to his will, and now he ſays <hi>turn me Lord and I ſhal be turned.</hi> Why when he is of the mind that God ſhould have the whole rule of him, then God pitties him, <hi>and earneſtly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers him</hi> ſtill, and will ſhortly hide himſelf no longer from him, will be kept no longer off him, <hi>I will have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It may be thou wouldſt at firſt turn to

Chriſt ſays we muſt then each keep our own. If thou wilt not part with thy eſtate, give, and forgive, and ſubmit to whatever I require, It muſt ſtand as it doth, I ſhall not declare my accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thee. But now when the ſoul is brought up to Chriſts terms, that it ſticks at nothing, (as terrours are the likeſt of any thing to bring thee unto it) then Chriſt will make no long tarrying from thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

                  </gap>ieſt too dear for Chriſt, to let him hereafter go for nothing. Thou art brought to ſee thy need to him, to have the experience of the Goſpell myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to find it in thy ſoul, what it is to be reſcued out of the hands of Satan by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, feeles how hardly thou art fetcht off, and this is like to lay a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170348:86"/>of a more mortified, ſpirituall, lively Chriſtian, then if thou cameſt to comfort ſooner. It is ſaid of <hi>Rhehoboam.</hi> He did evill becauſe <hi>he prepared not his heart to ſeeke the Lord.</hi> He was not <hi>fixed</hi> in his heart for God.<note place="margin">2 Cron. 12.18.</note> he was not thoroughly foundationed for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his heart was never right ſet, from a ſound inward principle of holineſſe, and ſo upon occaſion he did fall off to do evil in the ſight of the Lord. Certainly thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the moſt part prove beſt, that were either bred in the time of perſecution, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing but grace durſt have lookt out for Chriſt, and there were daily tryals to keep corruption down. Or elſs that are bred and brought out by inward ſharp terrours though in a time of peace. For this makes them know themſelves the better ever after. <hi>The March birds are alwaies the beſt Singers.</hi> And therefore thou maieſt take comfort in it, that thou art in the way not to <hi>be caſt off,</hi> but to <hi>be bred right,</hi> to have thy heart ſet right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. And therefore deſire to bring up the building with thee. Thou had better have thy troubles continue, then have them not cured. Better be in feares, then have hopes without a foundation.</p>
               <p>But then 6. Having brought up thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thus farr, It may be yet thou maieſt have no comfort. Thou art humbled for Old ſins, and <hi>all</hi> ſins, and brought to Chriſt univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and art throughly humbled to ſee thy need
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170348:87"/>to Chriſt, and wouldſt lay the foundation on the rock, yet thou haſt no comfort: why ſoul, Thy duty is not to deſpair now, nor to vex and fret thy ſelf with doubts about thy eſtate. <hi>There is other work to be done.</hi> And labour to <hi>doe the Duty of this thy conditon.</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170348:87"/>yet it is better to doe them as well as thou canſt, then not to doe them at all. It is an excellent obſervation one hath on <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that Peter <hi>bids pray</hi> though <hi>he was in the gall of bitterneſſe and the bond of Iniquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De. <hi>Arrow Smith.</hi> Acts. 8 12 23.</note> If it were Lawfull and a duty for <hi>Simon Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to pray, then ſure thou maieſt make bold to do thy duty too, thou canſt not be worſe then the Apoſtles ſays he was. <hi>Satan</hi> would ſcruple thee about duties, for he knows that is the way by which vertue and comfort ſhould come from Chriſt unto thee. But keep cloſe to Prayer what ever comes. And for the Sacrament, alas if thy heart be bad though thou goeſt it will not mend by ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, God may in ſome one Ordinance when thou thinkeſt not of it, give thee the comfort together of all the Ordinances in which thou haſt waited upon him, and hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to received nothing. He ſets up a Portion for every child that is not at preſent fit to have it, and thou maieſt have all together. But be ſure to continue in Prayer and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and at Sacraments if admitted to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Be dilligent in your lawfull calling. Let every man abide with God as he is called.</hi> Work with thy hands the thing that is honeſt,<note place="margin">1.

Many have many troublous thoughts for want of lawfull thoughts about their Buſineſſe. Many people have much trouble for want of better Buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (as I have heard,) when One complained to him of many ſad thoughts he gave them a taſk of getting <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> without Book as an only Remedy. Which when the party lookt ſtrangely at, he told him that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much of his trouble was for want of employment, and that would ſet him on work. And ſo certainly dilligence in an honeſt way is good Work for thee.</p>

                  <hi>He that beleeveth doth not make haſt.</hi> Be not too haſty with Chriſt; ſet not him a time. But wait till he pleaſe to come.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou art not ſo good but</hi> thou may be willing to tarry. Alas to have thee quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the foot of the ladder, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is not abſolute, and that it came no ſooner: It doth not become thee. The mercy is free. If thou conſidereſt how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite it is that ever it ſhould come to thee, thou wilt ſay there is no ſuch equivalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on thy part, but thou may thankfully tarry a time for it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The doubtfull caſes of ſuch as have made longer Profeſſion briefly diſtreſſed from the Obſervation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. TO thoſe that have made longer profeſſion, that are walking in darkneſſe and have no light. Many of theſe are ſeverally troubled in doubts a bout their Eſtate. This doctrine ſeaſonably preſſes them to hope, and it would find mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them in their ſeverall capacities, but to ſpeak to theſe particularly, would ſwe the diſcourſe; I ſhall therefore ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the generall, and the Spirit of God is able to melt it into the particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of trobled Souls, that are of this ſort.</p>
               <p>And ſoe 1. Take notice, That <hi>whatever</hi> was urged as <hi>a ground</hi> of Hope <hi>to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, belongs to you much more.</hi> You are as near as one of them if all be to begin now. Thou cryeſt out of an Hypocrite, as if his condition was worſe then any ones. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take notice, <hi>Every one is not an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170348:91"/>that only wants ſtrong grace,</hi> many they try themſelves for the truth of grace, by the ſigns of the degrees of grace. True grace is <hi>one thing</hi> and ſtrong &amp; grown grace is <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He is not an Hypocrite, <hi>that is not a compleat Chriſtian.</hi> A Chriſtian may be in preparation for Chriſt, and if not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come over, yet ſtill he is no impoſtor, onely in the way to a true ſetled ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is not an <hi>Hypocrite that hath ſome hypocryſie in him.</hi> None complain ſo of a bad heart as they who have <hi>the</hi> beſt Heart. But if Hypocryſie be found amongſt other ſins. If it be <hi>not</hi> allowed nor <hi>ontertained</hi> with delight. The ſoul ſhall not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with as the Abettor of ſuch a way.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for once diſſembled yet not an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though thou be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> yet there is hope; for thee, what though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an outſide profeſſion? (For <hi>that ſtring many one is harpning on</hi>) yet ſure <hi>thou</hi> art as near as the Drunkard, profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be. Never tell me <hi>that profeſſion</hi> ſhould hinder you in your coming to Chriſt: <hi>Athanaſius wiſhed all men were Hypocrites,</hi> That they had been all ſo good as <hi>Hipocrites</hi> are, For God hath more examplary honour from externall conformity, then from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen prophaneſs. And <hi>further it cannot</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your coming in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Profeſſion <hi>hath kept you from many
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170348:91"/>groſſe ſins,</hi> which would have been heavy on you if now to reckon for. Alas if thoughts of Evill have been ſo <hi>tedious to you,</hi> what then would you have done, if <hi>theſe thoughts</hi> had been words, and <hi>theſe Words</hi> actions. Therefore your profeſſion hath not hindered you <hi>thus far.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Profeſſion <hi>hath intituled you to many ſerious Chriſtians</hi> who would not ceaſe to pray for you, and would <hi>not</hi> eaſily lay <hi>their</hi> hands off you, for the Hopes <hi>they</hi> once had of you, you are hereby drawn to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who will be ſure <hi>to</hi> ſtick cloſe to you and pull hard before they looſe you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Profeſſion <hi>hath inured you to the means.</hi> This is the way <hi>to get comfort,</hi> many a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſoul knows <hi>not dutys,</hi> nor how to frame <hi>to them.</hi> But now profeſſion hath taught thee <hi>the manner of the God of the land</hi> and in this <hi>thou art aforehand.</hi> For this is the way to have <hi>comfort,</hi> or have the Heart brought over, if yet <hi>thou</hi> fall ſhort in this work. Many a new convert knows not how to ſet upon the duties of Religion whence he might receive ſtrength and comfort, which is a great diſadvantage to him. Now thy profeſſion befriends <hi>thee</hi> with this <hi>benefit.</hi> Thou art well uſed to Prayer, and reading, and hearing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a good Thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand in this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>All the danger</hi> in profeſſion, <hi>this very fear of thine about it, takes away.</hi> That <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170348:92"/>are in more danger then others, is not as if this ſin was more unlike to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned then another, but becauſe this kind of Sinners ſeldome, or never, repent, and come in, as other ſinners do. <hi>Hypocryſie</hi> hinders not pardon ſo oft as it hinders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now if this be thy fear and thy burthen, there is not this danger of thee. Profeſſion if not ſincere, it is dangerous only in this, when it is reſted on, when it is made a Chriſt, when men are thereby whole, and need not the Phyſitian, and ſo are hindred from comming to Chriſt for thorough healing. But when the ſoul is ſenſible of it, and ſtrives to come to Chriſt notwithſtanding it, there is no incapacity upon it, more then on any other ſtate for its acceptance with Chriſt. <hi>The Harlots and Publicans that enter into the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before Scribes and Phariſees;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 21.31</note> It is not meant of Heaven <hi>above;</hi> for <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> as ſuch, and <hi>Harlots</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> as ſuch, ſtand at an equall diſtance to glory. A prophane man dying ſo, cannot be ſaved no more then an Hypocrite that dies ſo. But the Kingdome of Heaven is taken here as frequently in the <hi>N. T.</hi> For the Kingdome of Grace, for the Kingdome of the Goſpel, and ſo the meaning of it is, <hi>Harlots</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> are ſooner converted, brought to repentance, to cloſe with the Goſpell-Kingdome, then the other are. Now this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170348:92"/>doth not imply that no <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſhould come in, nor that they ſhould be eſſe welcome if they did come in, then <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> and <hi>Publicans.</hi> Nay ſure if profeſſors come to Chriſt to deny their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, come off the condition that it is ſo hard to come off from, they ſhould be the rather entertained. It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that hinders acceptance unleſs it hinder repentance, if it hinder not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it cannot hinder your welcome. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Phariſee</hi> a liver without the Law, yet <hi>Paul,</hi> when repented,<note place="margin">Mat 21.29.30.</note> was received as ſoon as any other Sinner. The Similitude in that other place of the two Sons who were asked to Work in the Vineyard. The one denyed, the other broke his promiſe, now as the former repented of his unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly deniall, and went, ſo if the other had repented of his unfaithfull breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and had gone too, no doubt he had found acceptance. Thou talkeſt of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtian. But ſure an almoſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>may be</hi> an <hi>altogether</hi> Chriſtian, or els <hi>Paul</hi> had prayed for this in vain:<note place="margin">Acts. 16.29. 2. Pet. 2.21</note> For that place, <hi>Better never to have known the way of God</hi> &amp;c. This is not to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For 1. It is ſpoken of ſuch Chriſtians as were turned Seducers, Ringleadres of Hereſies, Perſecutors, Wolves, that were riſen up not ſparing the flock. Thine is not any groſſe apoſtaſie from profeſſion, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170348:93"/>only a diſcovery of inſufficiency. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is meant of them as finally perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that ſtate. It may be ſince thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedſt, thou maieſt have fallen by ſome <hi>great ſin,</hi> but thou haſt no heart to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in <hi>it.</hi> It lies not quiet in <hi>thy</hi> boſome, <hi>thou haſt no reſt in thy bones</hi> by reaſon of it, Thy <hi>Hypocryſie</hi> if ſuch, is not maintained, and thou art weary of the ſtate and willing to come off from it, theſe very <hi>Apoſtates</hi> if they had repented, <hi>there</hi> was hopes of their yet coming off. And therefore by all <hi>this</hi> it appears <hi>that</hi> they fear and trouble doth take off the danger of thy profeſſion, the fooliſh virgins if they had miſt their oyle in time it had been happy for them. If thou beeſt one of them thou haſt this advantage that thou miſſeſt oyle, before they that ſell it have ſhut up their ſhops. <hi>There is yet hope in this thing.</hi> It appears then that all the incouragements that have been given <hi>to that other ſort,</hi> of new beginners, doe belong to you much more, you may ſet in as beginners, and ſhare with them and welcome. All thoſe comforts do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you. Beſides a groſſe miſtake may hereby I hope in ſome meaſure be removed that many a ſoul thinks their hope is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them altogether, that they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence it from what is paſt allready or els have none the matter is not ſo, <hi>Thou art as free to take Chriſt as any other
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170348:93"/>man.</hi> It thou canſt not cleare it from thy profeſſion already <hi>that thou haſt taken him,</hi> thy profeſſion puts no incapacity upon thee but thou maieſt ſet in for him <hi>now</hi> as wel as any man. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is hopes for you. For God may withdraw from you (as he witholds from the other) for choice ends of good unto you. Though you walk in darkneſs and have no light, yet this may be for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt exceedingly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God may do it <hi>to fetch ſome ſin out of thee.</hi> There is ſome evill way in thee, ſome way of lying, ſome way of falſe gaine, ſome way of pride, humourſomeneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged paſſion, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> no marvell if thou he one of a troubled ſpirit. Much if not moſt uſuall trouble of ſpirit is obſerved to ariſe (as occaſioned at leaſt) either,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Out of melancholly as one in that bodily diſtemper (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays) one may as well cure a man of a palſy by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as ſuch a man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or out of ignorance of the nature and myſtery of Grace by Chriſt the tenour of the Goſpel covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">Or 3. From ſome diſobedience now, it may be for ſome thing of this laſt kind, and it is fatherly in him to withold from thee till this <hi>evill way</hi> be rooted out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be to fetch <hi>thee on to ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of Holyneſs.</hi> There are <hi>after work</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:170348:94"/>of <hi>converſion.</hi> And the change they make are as conſiderable almoſt, as if never any work had preceded. The diſciples who had left all for Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ma. 18.3</note> yet they muſt be <hi>converted againe,</hi> and more converted to this grace of humility, which yet was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in them. God will afford comforts at firſt on thoſe terms, on which after he will not continue them. He will bear with that in a beginner, that after he will ſtand upon to have it mended. He will not carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies towards us as babes, he looks we ſhould grow towards ſtrong men in Chriſt. <hi>New wine muſt not be put in to old Bottels.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9.17.</note> At firſt he would have thee ſpared in ſome things, but he expects that thou ſhouldſt in time get thy bottles ſo renewed, as to hold the ſtrongeſt Wine he hath for them: And ſo he withdraws from thee now; <hi>not becauſe</hi> thou art <hi>worſe then formerly</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art <hi>not better.</hi> He hath a deſign not to caſt <hi>thee of,</hi> but, <hi>to put the forward</hi> by this withdrawment. Some after work is on ſo t, It is not if I am to be converted now, o I had nothing before; thou art miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Some may have been before, and ſome may be to be added ſtill; God will have thee of the faſhions of the world, more humble, cloſe and ſerious then formerly, nothing ſo like to make thee a right mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Chriſtan, as terrours are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He may deſign thou ſhouldſt be more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170348:94"/>and ſetled then heretofore.</hi> He that hath his comforts deareſt, uſually hath them ſureſt. Thou knoweſt how thou cameſt by Chriſt, and ſo art like to keep thy hold of him. The ſpouſe that had loſt her beloved when ſhe found him,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.6.</note> ſhe would not let him go, ſhe charges by all <hi>the Hinds and Roes of the field,</hi> that they ſhould beware of awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him. Chriſt is gotten into the beleevers heart, he charges the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to keep the lumber of the world, and the luſts of the fleſh at a diſtance, that they awaken not Chriſt, nor diſturb his ſoul and him together. O ſuch a one came not ſo eaſily by him, as to give way to Luſts, to looſe him for trifles as many doe. Thou art like of any one,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> 
                  <hi>To go through the Wilderneſs leaning on him.</hi> Thou haſt come to Chriſt ſo importantly that thou canſt not trifle with him. Thy ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are like the wind that ſhakes the tree to make them more rooted. The winter froſt nips the trees at preſent to make them more fruitfull: So theſe troubles of thine will tend to thy greater ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and make thee more ſtedfaſt in the Lord.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt brought the matter to wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thou ſhalt never looſe the thing, nor yet thy waiting for it. If thou haſt ſearched thy heart for ſin, and about duty, and putteſt thy ſelfe to God to be ſearched,<note place="margin">Job 34 32.</note> and ſayſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:170348:95"/>thou ſhalt <hi>ſearch and find none,</hi> no ſin that I love and delight in.<note place="margin">Job. 34.32 Pſa. 17.3.</note> but had rather have it taken away, then to have it tarry, you ſhall find you ſhall be conſidered herein. Now as long as any ſin remains in this kind that the ſoul retains and from which it will not part. Chriſt may anſwer ſuch a one, the matter ſtickes not at me. Thou art not yet prepared thou art not yet reſolved on the match for thine own part. But if it be come clearly to this, that the matter is at waiting, thou wilt finde that either 1 Chriſt will come ſpeedily; or 2, make it eaſy to thee to wait for him, (as if he doe either, it will ſerve thee, and be a great mercy to thee.) and 3. When he comes he will abundantly recompence his delay, a ſmall moment I have forſaken thee, but <hi>with everlaſting kindneſs</hi> will I gather thee.<note place="margin">Es. 54.</note> And therefore ſtudy to bring it to this and thou wilt have no reaſon to ceaſe from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider you are not alone of Gods children in this affliction. God hath had many of his children in this wilderneſs, hath made their valley of <hi>Achor</hi> their door of Hope. <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi> &amp;c, now this ſure might ſtay thy heart a little in this condition of thine, to think,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That many of Gods eminent ſervants have been thus heretofore. 2. That many of Gods children beſides thee are ſo now or have been.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170348:95"/>
               <p n="3">3. That it is a condition many have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from, many have bleſſedly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of this ſtate. A diſeaſe many have been recovered from, and few have periſhed of: a curable, a comfortable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the condition, which God hath ſtil choſen to lead his beſt children through; eminenteſt Chriſtians, for life, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, God hath thus trained them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this might ſtay thee at preſent, thou art under the chaſtiſement of Sons, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Children, in theſe bittereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts thou canſt be in, as to inſtance,<note place="margin">Jon. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaid, he was caſt out of Gods ſight, <hi>yet he would look again towards Gods holy Temple.</hi> He thought in the Whales belly he ſhould never have been ſeen nor found out more, but he would have the other look at Chriſt (for the Temple was a type of him) before he quite gave up all, and you know he was brought out of that miſerable deep, and manifold priſon againe. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning himſelf.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.18.19.20.</note> For afflictions that ſtuck by him, <hi>God chaſtiſed him, and he was chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> God makes afflictions to tarry if he ſets them on,<note place="margin">Lan. 3.3.54.</note> he was likewiſe troubled with an unruly heart, <hi>Was like a Bullock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the Yoke.</hi> Yet he begs of God to turn, and <hi>this bemoaning Ephraim</hi> is <hi>a pleaſant Child</hi> in Gods eies and <hi>he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers him ſtill,</hi> nay <hi>earneſtly</hi> remembers him
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170348:96"/>ſtill, <hi>and will have mercy on him.</hi> The Church concludes her ſelf to be cut off, <hi>and laid</hi> in the dungeon and <hi>a ſtone upon her,</hi> made ſure for coming forth, yet ſhe thence cryed to God; and though none elſe could hear her where ſhe was, yet ſhe got the Lord to hear in that place, and he drew neer to her, notwithſtanding the dungeon and ſtone, and ſays, <hi>fear not.</hi> Nay the Church is gotten into further miſery,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.11. to 16.</note> ſhe is not only in the grave, but rotten, come <hi>to dry bones,</hi> and ſays her hope is loſt, and ſhe <hi>is cut off for her part,</hi> Whatever the Lord will do with others, ſays many ſuch a ſoul, I think <hi>for my part</hi> I may as well ſit ſtill as ſtir any further, I am gone I think for one. But God ſays, he would come to their very graves and <hi>open them,</hi> and <hi>call them</hi> forth and put his ſpirit into them, <hi>and make theſe very dry bones to live.</hi> The ſoul in a very far gone condition, the Lord will make it to live again. He will fetch it out of the grave and bring it back from corruption, when it ſays, it is <hi>cut off, for its part.</hi> The ſoul now in this condition from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, may move the Lord as <hi>David;</hi> Deal with me,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.132.</note> 
                  <hi>as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe that love thy name,</hi> or according to thy cuſtome to thoſe that love thy name. Men that give freely at their doors ſhall not want cuſtome, and ſo if they intend not to be troubled, they will ſay at firſt, If we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170348:96"/>uſe them to this we ſhall never be without ſuch gueſts; now God hath a deſign to ſhew mercy, and ſo he hath ſtill uſed poor people to his doors. They can challenge nothing at his dole door, but only his cuſtome of giving. He hath alwaies been wont to ſhew favour to thoſe that were diſtreſſed; and thou mayeſt hope he will be no worſe to thee then to another, and thou mayeſt be well aſſured of it. It is a good houſe, very good to the poor, and therefore if thou be needy call at it, and hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In this very condition thou art in.<note place="margin">Eſ 57.15.16. &amp; 66.1.2.</note> The Lord hath tender thoughts towards thee. <hi>The Lord, the high and lofty one, whoſe name is Holy,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are attributes that fright a poor ſinner, of any, <hi>The Lord, the high and lofty one.</hi> If I were righteous I would make <hi>Petition</hi> my only plea, ſo infinite is he, and I am nothing before him. But then he is, <hi>an holy God, and dwells in the holy place.</hi> I, ſays the ſinner, this affrights me, for he will not endure ſin, I am unclean, I am a ſinfull man, my hope is gone to deal with ſo pure a God; God hath mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe affrighting attributes on purpoſe, and this high God, this holy God, will ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out this man alſo, will look at him, <hi>dwell with him that is of an humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit,</hi> that is broken in peices for

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31.20.</note> ſince <hi>I ſpeak againſt him, I earneſtly remember him ſtill.</hi> The child cries in ſecret, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath beaten it, is ready to cry too. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren are pitifully troubled and <hi>Joſeph</hi> gets into his chamber and weeps too, one would have thought they had beene of no kinne to hear them talke together, but <hi>Joſeph</hi> did but this to bring them to repentance, <hi>Joſeph</hi> chides to their faces, and weeps in a corner, and at laſt weeps on their neck as their dear Brother <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The Lord hides great bowels from you all this time of your correction, but you will know he is choice of you while he ſpeaks bittereſt unto you, ſure thou art one very gratious with God. An eminent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſays, if he were to chooſe a mans pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he would deſire the prayers of ſuch an one above any mans,<note place="margin">Iſa. 54, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>O thou afflicted toſſed too and fro, and not comforteà,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord takes notice of all theſe paſſages, can call her by the name of all afflictions and ſufferings, which ſhews how much his heart is toward poor reatures in this condition. Nay he ſays plainly in all their afflictions he was afflicted.<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> Why thou wilt ſay then why did he not ſpare himſelf and me too; prethe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170348:97"/>why doth the mother whip the child whilſt at the ſame time ſhe could cry ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſtrike it, but ſhe will rather grieve her ſelf then undoe the child, and ſo is thy fathers Wiſdome and affection tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered towards thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Soules in this condition, ſhould not untowardly put off comforts, when they are offered unto them, ſometimes the word brings ſomething neare you, you know not how fairly you can put it off. And yet you do not take it, you are affraid of applying any comfort. Take heed you be not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in your trouble.</p>

Who made it. 2. Who is the beſt workman. 3. Hath alwaies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and knows the courſe of it, and he is like of any to ſet it a going. An heart that hath ſtood by thee a long time and hath not gone, this glorious artiſt can ſet it a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe, make it as perfect and better then ever it was, He can ſoone ſee what the matter is with it, whether the fault be in the ſpring, whether any wheele wanting, whether any thing broken, whatever it is, he that made it, can ſoone diſcover. It is but his touching it, and he can ſet it ſtraight and put it into good order as ever it was, and much better: ſo may thy heart be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God which thou ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of.

                  <p>The Obſervation improved to the Godly in reſpect of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe third and laſt improvement of the point to the Godly is, In reſpect of their affliction. The godly are apt to be diſcouraged and dejected about their outward afflictions. We ſhall make uſe of the doctrine as to them, that are in this eſtate. Doe not ſit down diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about your ſtate whatever it is, there is yet hope in this thing whatever the trouble is, inſtead of concluding it remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and letting down your heart about it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humble your ſelves for the ſin that you think brought this affliction on you.</hi> The Lord doth <hi>not willingly</hi> afflict, he doth not doe it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170348:106"/>out of his heart (as the marg. nath it) out of his meer pleaſure as the phraſe elſwhere ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,<note place="margin">Neh. 6.8.</note> when there is no ground for the thing doth not ſtrike,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9.</note> becauſe he will ſtrike as ſometimes our fathers of the fleſh, ſtrike children in tyranny, in paſſion, when angry with other matters, but he doth not ſtrike us ſo, he doth not uſually do it out of a will, though this were to be humbly ſubmitted unto, but he doth it out of ſome bleſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon you, ſearch therefore thy heart for former ſins as the Church did.<note place="margin">Lam. 3 40 Jer. 31.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ephraim</hi> is chaſtiſed and bears <hi>the reproach of his youth.</hi> And ſo God may bring thy youthfull ſin to thy remembrance, or ſome other miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and it is rather thy duty to ſearch for this, then to deſpair about thy affliction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour to part with any ſin your affliction diſcovereth.</hi> If it be not <hi>the ſin,</hi> yet part with that which comes next to hand, make clean work as you go, <hi>this</hi> is worth the finding, and this is the way to find out the reſt: God may ſtrike thee to have thee leave this ſin, though thou thinkeſt it is not the ſin the Lord ſtrikes at in thee.<note place="margin">Iſa 27.9.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the fruit unto Jacob to purge away all ſin,</hi> part with all you can find; and then you may be ſure you ſhal part with the right one. If God ſtrike at one, he intends thou ſhouldſt leave all thou findeſt. If the chiefe be not yet light on, deale with theſe thou meeteſt, to be doing with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Do the dutyes your affliction requires at
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170348:106"/>your hands.</hi> You are willing it may be to think ſuch a buſineſſe helpleſs, becauſe you have no mind to be at the coſt of uſing the meanes for it; Concludeſt ſuch a friend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable becauſe thou haſt a mind to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver praying for him, and dealing with him: the Church crys <hi>there is no hope,</hi> becauſe ſhe had another way to go, had other buſineſſe ſhe minded more then deliverance this way. Thou letteſt this thing lye deſperately becauſe thou haſt no mind to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in prayer, unwearied in thy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours about it, unleſſe it would come with eaſe, it will not come at all, as if nothing that is difficult were poſſible. Come let this deſpair of thine ſave thee no labour take paines about this thing, cry mightily to God in it, leave it not off, unleſſe the Lord hath ſaid to thee ſay, <hi>no more to me of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> many would have matters with eaſe and it will not be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thou art not alone in thy trouble, There is no temptation hath taken you but that which is common.</hi> Many of the pretious ſervants of God have had their ſore afflictions and all Gods ſervants ſtill aile ſomething this way. If you be without chaſtiſement <hi>whereof all are partakers,</hi> then are ye Baſtards and not Sons, would you be priviledged as none of Gods children are! Alas there are none but have their exerciſe, ſome one way and ſome another, every one muſt have ſomewhat to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170348:107"/>ballaſt an heart of vanity with, whileſt he ſailes through this world. The parable of the hares being hunted on every hand and in continuall feares, in diſcontent they would goe together and drowne themſelves; but as they went to the bridge of the river the frogs at all adventure leap into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them, whereupon they tooke courage that they were not the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures in the world, in that ſome were more affrighted then they. And ſo no doubt ſome are <hi>determinately</hi> miſerable in the very caſes, wherein you <hi>a little ſuſpect</hi> your condition.</p>
               <p>Doe not conclude any one child without affliction. For many one may have ſecret afflictions which they ſpeak not of, nay afflictions about ſuch ſecret things as is not fit for them to ſpeak of, thou knoweſt not what ſorrow they <hi>ſup in ſilence,</hi> what they ſuffer, and commit to God only, no friend hath the knowledge of it. And ſo this way thoſe thou thinkeſt to be moſt free, may have a greater burther then thine is, becauſe they have no eaſe by complaining as thou haſt. Do not ſay any one is free, unleſſe you hear any one complain for want of affliction. Theſe are rare but if ſuch a one ſhould be, I would ſay to him, it is time enough yet. There is room for many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſtand, betweene this and his latter end, and therefore this need not trouble,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170348:107"/>he may meet with his childes part time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough yet.<note place="margin">Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for peace. p.</note> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us an experience concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this way. That he was ſufficiently hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped againſt ſuch a temptation.

                  <hi>Pittacus</hi> when he had invited many ſtrangers to dinner and his ſhrewd wife came among them, and overthrew the diſhes: he ſaid, no man is without his croſſe, were it not for this one thing I were the happyeſt man.<note place="margin">Jer. 10.19.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a grief and I muſt bear it.</hi> Every one hath ſome, and this is mine. It is but one bundle and I muſt make it part of my work to carry it as ſtrongly and patiently as I can, ſome men are of ſingular uſe whoſe chiefe work is to carry burthens.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Thou haſt cauſe to bleſſe God that it is neither carnall proſperity, nor carnall adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the former would not have been ſo good as affliction, the latter much worſe. As long as thou art in the ſtate of a Child no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what thy condition is. If thou hadſt the world at pleaſure, and wantedſt grace what would it avayle thee, and if thou beeſt in adverſity, and yet art not wicked, withall, it is ſome eaſe to thee.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170348:108"/>and wicked too, and therefore herein thy condition is better, thou beareſt fruit in this affliction of holyneſs which is better then proſperity, like the flower in <hi>china</hi> that in Winter looſes its leaves yet hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother flower though not ſo beautifull, yet ſweeter then the ſummer flower was.
